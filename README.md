ðŸ“– Project Description

Project Chronos is a web-based tool designed to reconstruct and provide context for fragmented or obscure text from the early internet. Using the power of Google's Gemini AI, this application can take a cryptic sentence from an old forum or chat log, reconstruct it into modern English, explain the slang and cultural references, and automatically find relevant sources on the web to provide a complete "Reconstruction Report.
This project fulfills the goal of demonstrating AI-powered text reconstruction and automated contextual analysis through a simple and intuitive user interface.

âœ¨ Features

AI-Powered Reconstruction: Leverages the Gemini 2.5 Flash model to intelligently fill in missing words and context.
Automated Contextual Search: Automatically performs a Google search to find relevant articles and definitions for old slang and cultural references.
Interactive Web Interface: A beautiful and easy-to-use front-end built with HTML and Tailwind CSS that works in any modern browser.
Command-Line Fallback: Includes the original Python script for command-line operation.
