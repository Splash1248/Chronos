## üìñ Project Description

Project Chronos is a full-stack web application designed to act as a "digital archeologist." It takes obscure or fragmented text from old forums, chat logs, or message boards and brings it to life.

The application is built with a secure Python Flask backend that handles all interactions with external APIs. The frontend is a sleek, single-page application that allows users to input text and view a "Reconstruction Report." This report, generated by Google's Gemini AI, not only reconstructs the text into modern English but also explains the slang and cultural references from that era. It then automatically finds relevant web sources to provide deeper context.

This project demonstrates a practical application of AI for text reconstruction and contextual analysis, all wrapped in a modern, secure web server architecture.

## ‚ú® Features

**AI-Powered Reconstruction:** Leverages the Gemini 2.5 Flash model to intelligently interpret and modernize cryptic text.

**Automated Contextual Search:** Automatically performs a Google Custom Search to find relevant articles and definitions for the original fragment.

 **Interactive Web Interface:** A responsive and easy-to-use frontend built with HTML and Tailwind CSS that communicates with the Flask backend.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

**Backend:** Python, Flask, Google Generative AI, Google Custom Search API

**Frontend:** HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript (Fetch API)

**Environment:** python-dotenv for managing API keys.

## üöÄ Setup and Installation

To get this project running on your local machine, please follow these steps.
1. Clone the Repository

        git clone https://github.com/Splash1248/Chronos.git
        cd Chronos

2. Set Up the Python Environment

    Create a virtual environment:

        python -m venv env


    Activate the environment:

        On Windows (CMD/PowerShell):

        .\env\Scripts\activate

        On macOS/Linux:

        source env/bin/activate

3. Install Dependencies

    Install all the packages from this file:

        pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Configure API Keys

    This project requires API credentials from Google. You must create a .env file in the root of the project to store them.

    Create a file named .env and add your keys in the following format:

        GEMINI_API_KEY="your-google-ai-api-key-here"
        SEARCH_API_KEY="your-google-custom-search-api-key-here"
        SEARCH_ENGINE_ID="your-search-engine-id-here"

## üíª How to Run the Application

With your virtual environment activated and the .env file configured, you can start the web server.

Run the Flask application from your terminal:

    python run.py

Open your web browser and navigate to the following address:
    
    http://127.0.0.1:5000

You can now use the application directly in your browser.

## üìÇ Project Structure

The project is organized with a clear separation between the backend server, core logic, and frontend templates.
